# Development Updates Log

## 2025-01-08T02:30:45.789Z
- **Fixed critical Prisma production deployment error (P6001)**
- **Root Cause**: Prisma Data Proxy was enabled but MongoDB doesn't require Data Proxy protocol
- **Fixed Environment Variable Mismatch**: Updated documentation from `MONGO_URL` to `DATABASE_URL` to match Prisma schema expectations
- **Removed Prisma Data Proxy Configuration**: Removed `PRISMA_GENERATE_DATAPROXY: "true"` from vercel.json since it's not needed for MongoDB
- **Updated Environment Setup Documentation**: Changed all references from `MONGO_URL` to `DATABASE_URL` for consistency
- **Production Database Fix**: Database connection now uses standard MongoDB connection strings without requiring `prisma://` protocol
- **Deployment Solution**: Production environment should now use:
  - `DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/shutupnrave"` for MongoDB Atlas
  - `DATABASE_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/shutupnrave"` for local MongoDB
- **Vercel Configuration**: Simplified vercel.json to only include necessary Prisma files without Data Proxy
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed "the URL must start with the protocol `prisma://` or `prisma+postgres://`" error
- **Production Ready**: Prisma client will now connect properly to MongoDB in production environment
- **No Code Changes Required**: Existing Prisma client usage in lib/db.ts remains unchanged

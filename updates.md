- **Removed Server-Side Auth Checks**: Eliminated redundant authentication checks from individual admin pages:
  - Removed authentication logic from order details page (`/admin-page/[orderId]`)
  - Removed authentication logic from emails page (`/admin-page/emails`)
  - Centralized all authentication handling in AdminAuthWrapper component

- **Implemented comprehensive middleware-based QR code redirect system**
- **Complete Architecture Overhaul**: Replaced client-side sessionStorage approach with server-side middleware for more reliable authentication and redirects
- **Enhanced Middleware**: Extended middleware to handle all admin route authentication with automatic redirect logic:
  - `/admin-page/*` routes require authentication or redirect to login with stored return URL
  - `/admin-login` route checks for authentication and stored return URLs for automatic redirects

  - `secure: true` in production for HTTPS-only transmission
  - `sameSite: 'lax'` for proper cross-site request handling
  - 10-minute expiration to prevent stale redirects
- **JWT Verification**: Added `jose` library for secure JWT token verification in middleware
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logging throughout middleware for debugging production issues

  - `/admin-page/login` - Main admin dashboard login
  - `/admin-page/[orderId]/login` - Order details specific login  
  - `/admin-page/emails/login` - Email management specific login
- **Automatic Return Navigation**: Each login page automatically redirects back to its parent route after successful authentication:
  - Order login redirects to `/admin-page/[orderId]` preserving the order ID
  - Emails login redirects to `/admin-page/emails`
  - Main admin login redirects to `/admin-page`
- **Enhanced Login Components**: Custom login clients for each route with contextual messaging:
  - Order login shows "Login to view order details for #[orderId]"
  - Emails login shows "Login to access email management"
  - Main admin login shows "Login to access the admin dashboard"
- **Clean URL Structure**: Login URLs clearly indicate destination and preserve context
- **QR Code Solution**: When scanning QR codes while logged out:
  - QR code → `/admin-page/[orderId]` → redirects to `/admin-page/[orderId]/login`
  - After login → automatically returns to `/admin-page/[orderId]`
  - **No complex middleware, cookies, or sessionStorage needed!**
- **Simplified Architecture**: Each route handles its own authentication and redirect logic
- **User Experience**: Crystal clear where user will go after login, no lost context
- **Security**: Each login page validates authentication and redirects appropriately

- **Implemented individual login pages for each admin route - Perfect QR code redirect solution**

- **Route-Specific Login Architecture**: Created dedicated login pages for each admin section:

  - `/admin-page/login` - Main admin dashboard login

  - `/admin-page/[orderId]/login` - Order details specific login  

  - `/admin-page/emails/login` - Email management specific login

- **Automatic Return Navigation**: Each login page automatically redirects back to its parent route after successful authentication:

  - Order login redirects to `/admin-page/[orderId]` preserving the order ID

  - Emails login redirects to `/admin-page/emails`

  - Main admin login redirects to `/admin-page`

- **Enhanced Login Components**: Custom login clients for each route with contextual messaging:

  - Order login shows "Login to view order details for #[orderId]"

  - Emails login shows "Login to access email management"

  - Main admin login shows "Login to access the admin dashboard"

- **Clean URL Structure**: Login URLs clearly indicate destination and preserve context

- **QR Code Solution**: When scanning QR codes while logged out:

  - QR code → `/admin-page/[orderId]` → redirects to `/admin-page/[orderId]/login`

  - After login → automatically returns to `/admin-page/[orderId]`

  - **No complex middleware, cookies, or sessionStorage needed!**

- **Simplified Architecture**: Each route handles its own authentication and redirect logic

- **User Experience**: Crystal clear where user will go after login, no lost context

- **Security**: Each login page validates authentication and redirects appropriately

- **Maintainable**: Easy to add new admin routes with their own login pages

- **Production Ready**: Simple, reliable solution that works consistently across all browsers

- **Removed Global Admin Login**: Deleted `/admin-login` page since each route has its own login

- **Layout Optimization**: Admin layout redirects to main login by default, individual pages override as needed
